# BurnishRushReminder
Get a warning when Burning Rush is active during combat for Warlocks.

## What is this?
Are you tired of accidentally leaving Burning Rush on mid-fight, and slowly cooking yourself alive? This is an addon for WoW Retail where a text reminder will show on your screen if you have Burning Rush active during combat, so you can stop losing health from your spicy feet while you fight!

## How to Use
1.  Install the addon.
2.  Log into World of Warcraft Retail.
3.  Go to `Options` -> `AddOns` -> `Burning Rush Reminder`.
4.  You can also type /brr to open the settings.
5.  Change any settings as you wish, then get to combat and never cook yourself mid-fight again!
